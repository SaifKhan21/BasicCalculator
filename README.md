# Basic Calculator

This is a basic console calculator program written in C#. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, view their recent calculation history, and run a set of automated tests.

## Features

* Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculations with both integers and decimals
* Handles invalid inputs such as non-numeric characters, division by zero, and taking the square root of a negative number
* Stores and displays the last 10 calculations performed
* Contains a set of unit tests to verify calculator functionality
